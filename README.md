Here is realisation of some matrix interaction with PDCURSES Library to create some visual color components.
Task of the laboratory work is to create matrix output with painted secondary diagonal, in this diagonal must be found even numbers and counted the sum of these 
even numbers, replace 4th row values by sum and paint it too.
Here i haven't used a lot C++ approach cause of requirements of laboratory work training manual.
